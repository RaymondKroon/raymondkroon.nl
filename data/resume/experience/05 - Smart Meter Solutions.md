The company was struggling to meet deadlines. This partly because culture and
partly because of people. Together with a co-worker we implemented some
improvements: (better) Agile/Scrum, introducing Domain Driven Design, and test
driven development. Also, we created a CI/CD pipeline, making our releases much
more predictable and much faster.
