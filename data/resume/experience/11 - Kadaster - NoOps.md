I am responsible for the NoOps strategy at Kadaster. NoOps is about reducing unnecessary
Ops and improving the overall Developer Experience. DevOps
teams at Kadaster use pretty modern tech stacks. Because platform support
is lacking, every team has to a lot of extra work beside operating their own
applications.

I am responsible for creating and migrating to the Managed Application Platform. This platform is a crucial part of the cloud strategy and the migration to our new datacenter.
