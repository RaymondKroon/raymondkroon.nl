I am responsible for the NoOps strategy at Kadaster. NoOps is about reducing unnecessary
Ops and improving the overall Developer Experience. DevOps
teams at Kadaster use modern tech stacks and, because platform support
is lacking, every team has to do a lot of extra work beside just operating their own
applications.

Part of the project is creating and migrating to the Managed Application Platform. This platform is a crucial part of the cloud strategy and the migration to our new datacenter.
