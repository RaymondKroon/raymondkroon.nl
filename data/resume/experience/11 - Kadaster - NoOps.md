I am responsible for the NoOps strategy at Kadaster. NoOps is about reducing unnecessary
Ops and other no-value-adding work for the DevOps teams. DevOps
teams at Kadaster use pretty modern tech stacks. But because platform support
is lacking, every team has to a lot of extra work beside operating their own
applications.

I am responsible for creating and migrating to the Managed Application Platform. This platform is a crucial part of the cloud strategy and the migration to our new datacenter.
