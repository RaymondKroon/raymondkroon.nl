PDOK.nl is a joint venture of Kadaster and other government organisations. Its goal
is to host open geospatial datasets.
When I joined adding new datasets was completely not automated, and the release
cycle was once a month. The first one and half year I use most of my team
(motivating other people) to automate processes and improve quality.
After this my focus was on streamlining and speeding up the process of importing
new datasets, and on adjusting our architecture for the steadily increasing usage of
our services.
